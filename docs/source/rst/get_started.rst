This library allows you to make boolean operations between subsets on the real line:

* `EmptyR1`: An empty subset, without any elements
* `WholeR1`: The entire real line
* `SingleValueR1`: An subset with only one element
* `IntervalR1`: An subset of continuous elements between 
* `DisjointR1`: The union of `SingleValueR1` and `IntervalR1`
